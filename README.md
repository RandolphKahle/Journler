### Sprouted Dependencies

1. SproutedUtilities
2. SproutedInterface
3. SproutedAVI

Journler relies on a three additional frameworks from Sprouted. SproutedAVI handled's audio-visual input and is already available at github. The Utilities and Interface frameworks are forthcoming.

Initially I thought it wise to collect generic code used in Journler into these two separate frameworks to improve their re-usability. I no longer believe this was necessary, and a portion of the open sourcing effort includes the decomposition of these frameworks into their constituent parts and the re-incorporation of that code back into the main Journler project.

The issue is not so much that the code is kept separate. In fact I will likely continue to maintain separate repositories for re-usable code. The issue is that I combined this code into a framework, whereas I should have just grabbed the source files from the repository as I required them.

### About Journler Open Source

This is the complete Xcode project for the Journler application, including source code, interface files and application resources, and it is the same code I am currently developing for the 2.6 Mac OS compatibility update . Compiling this project will produce an application identical to the current version of the publicly available 2.6b update. As I make improvements to the code I will push them to github so that this repository should reflect changes to the latest binaries.

The 2.6 compatibility update is a significant undertaking. In addition to the Journler code itself, I am also updating local frameworks on which the application is dependent as well as incorporating newer versions of other 3rd party code and frameworks. The update mostly consists of refactoring existing code and replacing deprecated API calls. To get an idea of just how much work is involved, simply compile the application and have a look at the warnings.

Moreover, the code is a mess, and much of it is four, five and even six years old, written before I had developed solid object-oriented coding practices. Object coupling is a problem, although the application does have clearly defined data and interface layers, and an overall hierarchy should become evident upon investigation of the code. I may try to produce a diagram detailing the relationships and spheres of influence for future development.

A word about the data layer: it was written in the days before Core Data. If all you've ever known is Core Data, welcome to the painful world of writing a quasi-relational database layer from scratch in a time before you even realized that's what you were doing.

Journler is not being open source for any specific reason. Although there is a hope that other
developers may pick up the code and customize it for their own use or improve it for general
use, I believe the significance of the application lies not so much in the implementation but
in the idea. The code is mostly obsolete, and a much more efficient project could be begun
from scratch to realize the Journler vision.
